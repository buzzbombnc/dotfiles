Basic dotfiles for use with Mac Terminal, but maybe more eventually.

Other requirements
------------------

* [Git completion script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash) stored at `~/.git-completion.bash`.
* Better git prompt script: `git clone https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt.git ~/.bash-git-prompt --depth=1`

TODO
----

* More detail around all the Mac Terminal keyboard changes!
