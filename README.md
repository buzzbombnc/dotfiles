Basic dotfiles for use with Mac Terminal, but maybe more eventually.

Other requirements
------------------

* [Git completion script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash) stored at `~/.git-completion.bash`.
* [Git prompt script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh) stored at `~/.git-prompt.sh`.

TODO

* More detail around all the Mac Terminal keyboard changes!
